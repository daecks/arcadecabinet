Configuration files for my advancemame, raspberry pi powered cocktail cabinet.

For whatever reason, I initially set this up to use the root user (maybe it was required at the time?)

Configuration files are located in /home/root/.advance.
Roms are located in /usr/local/share/advance/roms
Disabled roms are placed in a "disabled" directory (i.e., it doesn't recurse).
